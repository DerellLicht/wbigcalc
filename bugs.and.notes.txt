==============================================================

> continue adding button functions to project
All button functions need the same "clean up X" code as Add() etc required

> LastX doesn't work

> finish eliminating GetChar() from the project

Removed all 'print to printer/file' routines from Windows version.
I don't really think those operations are required in a calculator such as this.
Instead, I will try to make it possible to copy-and-paste from any display windows.
