<ins>WBigCalc 6.0 - BigCalc ported to 32-bit Windows utility</ins>

BigCalc is an extended-precision scientific calculator, supporting numbers up to 1075 digits.  
BigCalc uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), as originally used in HP calculators;  
RPN is an efficient method for handling complex computations,
but is rarely seen in pocket calculators any more.

The original program was written by Judson D. McClendon for MSDOS, ca 1999.  
Neither the author nor the original program appear to be present on the internet any more.

I previously ported this program to 32-bit Windows console utility, which can be found in my repository as https://github.com/DerellLicht/bigcalc.

The original readme file is included as bigcalc.txt
