Derell,

I was just going through my Dad’s emails (Judson McClendon) and saw your email about you modifying
the Bigcalc source for Windows.  How cool!

My Dad is still alive and fairly well, but he doesn’t really get online much anymore.  
He’s retired and loving it.

I just wanted to reach out because I think it is amazing the reach that my father’s programming
efforts have made over the years.  So many interesting people around the world have reached out, 
saying that they are getting use and pleasure from something my Dad did as a hobby in former years.

Dad did maintain a website for a long time where all of his public domain source code was available
for download with a little write-up about each program.  You can still find snapshots of the site
in the Internet Archive.  His old domain was “sunvaley.com”.  Notice the word “valley”
only has one “L” because when Dad registered the domain, “sunvalley.com” was already taken.

I may download and check out your program and see what you’ve evolved it into on your end.

How cool.  All the best wishes from Alabama.

Kind regards,

John McClendon
